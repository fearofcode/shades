# Shades.app

Shades.app is a small utility that places transparent overlays atop portions of your screen. When you run it, you'll see a :dark_sunglasses: icon appear in your menu bar.

To add a new shade window, go to the sunglasses icon in your menu bar, click to show the menu, and select 'Add shade window'. At this point you can move and resize the shade window. When you're done, toggle the 'Move/resize shades' item in the menu, and all your mouse clicks will go through the window, as if it weren't there at all. 

You can change the color and opacity of the shade windows by selecting the 'Change shade color' item in the menu.

The toolbar icon is gratefully taken from the [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) project.
