# Shades.app

Shades.app is a small utility that places transparent overlays atop portions of your screen. Think of it as a dumber, more granular version of [Flux](https://justgetflux.com) or [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207570). 

You can download a prebuilt version of it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8qm1r5skaiim7t/Shades.zip?dl=0).

When you run it, you'll see a :dark_sunglasses: icon appear in your menu bar.

To add a new shade window, go to the sunglasses icon in your menu bar, click to show the menu, and select 'Add shade window'. At this point you can move and resize the shade window. When you're done, toggle the 'Move/resize shades' item in the menu, and all your mouse clicks will go through the window, as if it weren't there at all. 

You can change the color and opacity of the shade windows by selecting the 'Change shade color' item in the menu.

While configuring shade windows, click the Close icon in the upper left corner of the window to close a window.

Your current window color and configuration will be saved when you quit the app and reloaded when you start it again.

The toolbar icon is gratefully taken from the [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) project.

## TODO

* Consider making close view opaque

## Possible further enhancements

* Little quality of life enhancements: fill in the AppIcon, add option to start on startup, etc
* Per-window configuration
